================================
A Virtual Pediatric Airways Workbench (VPAW) is a patient-centered surgical planning software system targeted to pediatric patients with airway obstruction. VPAW enables a  full surgical planning pipeline, which includes: importing DICOM images, segmenting the airway, interactive 3D editing of airway geometries to express potential surgical treatment planning options, and creating input files for offline geometric analysis and computationalfluid dynamics simulations for evaluation of surgical outcomes.  This repository contains a new generation of VPAW that is developed using [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/).

_This project is in active development and may change from version to version without notice._

## Features

The project is being actively developed and our plan is to implement the following functionalities to enable users to express potential surgical treatment planning options for patients with airway obstruction.

A typical workflow will consist of the following steps:

* Importing DICOM images (will initially support CT data)
* Segmenting the airway (as described by _Hong et al_ in section 2.1 of [1])
* Interactive 3D editing of airway geometries leveraging integration of 3D pointing devices such as [3D Systems Touch](https://www.3dsystems.com/haptics-devices/touch) through the OpenHaptics interface
* Creating input files for offline geometric analysis and CFD simulations

## History

The initial version of this project was developed between 2010 and 2015 in the context of supporting predictive modeling for treatment of upper airway obstruction in young children, the project as well as the team involved are respectively described and acknowledged in the [referenced](#how-to-cite) publication.
