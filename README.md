A Virtual Pediatric Airways Workbench (vpaw) is a patient-centered surgical planning software system targeted to pediatric patients with airway obstruction. VPAW is enables a  full surgical planning pipeline, including importing DICOM images, segmenting the airway, interactive 3D editing of airway geometries to express potential surgical treatment planning options, and creating input files for offline geometric analysis and computationalfluid dynamics simulations for evaluation of surgical outcomes.  This repostiory contains the next generation of vpaw that is developed using [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/).
